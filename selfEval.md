# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?  

I feel like the Objects lesson and assignment was relatively easier to grasp as I already had the foundation of arrays and functions to build on. I was able to grasp Objects pretty quickly on Saturday morning and teaching Nicole and Gavin yesterday in our study hall and pairing session helped reinforce those ideas for me. Although I did forget how to print the value of a specific element and was trying to use the arrays index method for a while to no avail. I googled it and looked back on the lesson and my notes and talked through it.  

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?  

My workflow is ok... I feel like it's taking me a really long time because I'm actively studying and reviewing materials everytime I'm doing the assignments. I just want to make sure I have not only an understanding of the concepts but also when specifically to employ which syntax. I feel my perfectionism creeping in and because I don't have a lot of commitments outside of my personal life, I have been dedicating huge chunks of time to studying. I'm taking breaks every half hour to refresh and stretch, do some physical therapy and move around. I put my phone on silent and have been trying to focus on the work for at least 25 min at a time.  

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?  

I want to remember the ways of printing specific key pairs and build on this knowledge. I will definitely be using my assignments as a log to study with during the month of June. Objects I feel pretty good about, it's more functions that I will need to review more before the evaluation on Thursday.
